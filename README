This is the source for the firmware for TellStick Net.
The firmware must be compiled on a Linux machine.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software is required to build the firmware for TellStick Net.

* Hi-Tech C Pro for the PIC18 MCU Family, version 9.63PL3 or later.
  http://www.htsoft.com

* CMake version 2.8.0 or later
  http://www.cmake.org

* Git
  http://git-scm.com

* atftp (for automatic firmware uploading)
  ftp://ftp.mamalinux.com/pub/atftp/

Prepare the source
------------------

Check out the source from the Telldus repository. We use submodules so
they must also be initialized.

  git clone http://git.telldus.com/tellstick-net.git
	cd tellstick-net
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Compile the source
------------------

We recommend you do an "out of source" build. Create a folder and
initiate a cmake build cache in it.

  mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../firmware -DPICC18_PATH=<path to picc18> -DDEBUG=n -DDEVICE_ADDRESS=<ip address for TellStick Net>

Now build the source.
  make

The buildscript automatically uploads the new firmware to the device after a successful build.
If you don't need the automatic upload function, pass -DDO_BOOTLOADING_OVER_TCPIP=n when initiating
the CMake cache.
